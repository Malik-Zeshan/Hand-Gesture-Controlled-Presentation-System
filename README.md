> 𝑳𝒐𝒏𝒈 𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: The system can capture hand gestures from a distance of more than 8 to 10 feet, through the default laptops/PC camera, slightly dependent on the lighting condition.
> 𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒍: It only responds to pre-fed hand gestures, meaning unintentional hand movements won’t disrupt your presentation. 
> 𝑨𝒏𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: You can also highlight any of the point or line or anything else on the screen though the specified gestures.
> 𝑬𝒙𝒆𝒄𝒖𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑭𝒊𝒍𝒆: This project give feel like a proper software because it includes an executable (.exe) file that can be used on any computer in classrooms or conference rooms etc. With just a single click, you can start using it, no need to install any dependencies or libraries. Any laptop or computer with a camera can run it smoothly. Simply add the path to the folder containing your slides, and you're all set! 
> 𝑼𝒔𝒆𝒓-𝑭𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒍𝒚 𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒆: The project features a simple and interactive GUI that prompts for the slide path and displays the camera output in a suitable place.

This project showcases how computer vision can enhance our everyday tasks, making presentations more interactive and engaging.
Thank you for taking the time to read about my project!
